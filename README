    Experimental HTTP over WebSocket Golang package
======================================================

Define callbacks for urls in your javascript,
and using the wshttp package when one of
those urls are requested, the request is 
passed to the browser that registered a 
callback for it.

Notes
=====

Go version: it compiles with the current (19/10/2011)
 Go sources

Stability: it is not stable. Simply put, don't use it.
I hacked up this thing in about 2 days, without
thinking about it too much. This is also reflected
into the source - which are a completely mess.

Why?
====

For fun. I wanted to learn a bit of Go, and thought
that it might be a funny pet project.

Future?
=======

Well, when Go will be more stable, I might think of
doing this thing properly. At the beginning I wanted
to use Socket.io (using the go-socketio package),
but I did not managed to make it work. I suppose that
when Go will be more stable, also the socket.io port
will be. I'm looking forward for that to happen.
And then again, I did it for fun, if You have a good
idea of actually how to use http over websocket,
drop me a message!
